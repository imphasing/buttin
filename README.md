this is a simple set of AWS Lambda functions for logging diaper changes for my sw8 baby. Logs to a dynamodb table, reporting interface is work in progress still.

This is hooked up to an AWS IoT button stuck to my changing table, ezpz to log diapers without having to remember to whip my phone out to use one of those stupid apps.
